                <p>Hello! My name is Ricardo Granados Macias! I am a passionate computer science student at California State University Fullerton! 
                    I am currently a senior and expect to graduate in spring 2025! My interest in computer science was ignited when I first played 
                    video games as a kid! Now i'm currenlty interested in software engineering,
                    mobile app development, web design, and machine learning! Take a look around my page to get to know me more!
