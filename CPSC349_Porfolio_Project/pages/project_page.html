                        TrendSpyer was developed in a group of four students. It is a community based safety app, that allows users to report incidents or suspicious activity as 
                        they occur and display the reports onto map for other users to see. I was responsible for developing the back end of the project using MongoDB, and writing API's
                        to login users and retrieve reports to display on the map.

                        Card Calamity is an Android mobile applicaation built using React-Native. Card Calamity is a card collecting game that allows users to virtually collect 
                        digital cards. They can build their own dream collections, build their own decks from the cards they collected and search for cards. Users can search for 
                        cards they want to own using a free API, which allows them to add it to their own collection.

                        Email Evictor is a machine learning model that determines whether or not an email is spam depending on a handful of features. Features include, capitilization, 
                        use of an unecessary punctuation, capitilization, numbers, spelling and grammar errors. Using Sckit-learn and an email dataset from Kaggle, my group of three members
                        trained and created a classification model to solve the issue of spam email identification.
